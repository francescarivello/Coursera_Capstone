    "I am italian living in the Netherlands, so this data analysis is very interesting for me. Italian restaurants are relatively cheap compared to other types of restaurants and they are suitable for all types of customers, therefore I will assume that the wealth of a certain neighborhood will not influence the chances of success of the restaurant. As a first analysis, I will consider the vicinity to another italian restaurant as the main cause of lower incomes generated.\n",

    "The problem is that Amsterdam is also very pricy, rents can be sky high so the the investment can be also very risky due to the high costs of maintaining the restaurant. \n",

    "To make sure there is a return in the investment of opening a restaurant, I will study where opening a restaurant in Amsterdam is the most profitable due to the lowest amount of competitors in the vicinity."
